# My Trip Itinerary
A Trip Itinerary project made in React.

## Features
* Saves when you leave the site without requiring any type of login or authentication, using browser localStorage.
* A large selection of website themes that can be chosen by the user.


If the background is white that means that the background is still loading, as they are high resolution, so just wait until it loads in.

No API keys or coding is needed! Simply download it and run it as you would with any Create React App normally.
